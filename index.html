            Social media platforms, and streaming services such as YouTube, encourage the destruction one's natural creativity and thought process through excess amounts of time spent using these services.

            As a 'User', I have unlimited access to countless videos via Internet, allowing focus to be easily drifted.

       <h2>Interface</h2>

       <p>The Interface is this situation is YouTube, provided hours of distracting content, thus preventing me completing my tasks with absolute focus. </p>

        <p>The Address Layer provides the connection between the Interface and User. This layer is critical, as it allows for users to connect to any corner of our planet, simply through an internet connection, expanding our environment rapdily. Without this internet connection, our so called 'space' becomes closed off. </p>

        <p>The power of YouTube stems from the amount of content available on one Interface, stored in data centers. The transition from one video to the next without break represents the countless videos avaiable on the application. This leads to the core issue behind our ability to focus, as video after video floods are mind, we lose concept the concept of reality, and start to expect life to happen as it appears through videos and other forms of media.</p>

        <p>YouTube has allowed people from all corners of the earth to learn about one another, regardless if that person has left their own country. Though YouTube can have long term effects on our development as individuals, the access it provides in terms of understanding our world beyond our boundaries is uncomparable.</p>
